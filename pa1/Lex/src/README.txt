-List.java-
This is a doubly linked List ADT that includes a "cursor" for navigating list 
nodes. This ADT is used by Lex.java to organize and navigate the integer value 
indices of an unsorted array of strings. 

-Lex.java-
This class functions as the I/O manager of the file arguments. It also contains 
the sorting algorithm based off of insertionSort which sorts each line of the 
input file into alphabetical order prior to writing it to the designated output 
file.

-ListClient.java-
A test client for the List ADT.

-Makefile-
Used to compile the above .java files and create an executable .jar file called 
Lex. Also contains a clean utility that deletes all class files and the created 
.jar file from the current directory.
